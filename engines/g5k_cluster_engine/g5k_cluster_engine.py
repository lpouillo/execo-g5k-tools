    Well suited for bag-of-task kind of jobs, where the cluster is one

    storage, network, etc.

    This engine's workflow is to continuously poll the involved
    clusters and check how much oar jobs are running, how much oar
    jobs are waiting. As soon as number of jobs waiting is below a
    threshold (and if the number of running jobs is not over a
    threshold), it submits a job, then runs a worker thread which
    waits for the job to start, gets the nodes and passes control to
    client code. So, from the client point of view, it is only needed
    to implement:
    `g5k_cluster_engine.g5k_cluster_engine.get_clusters`,
    `g5k_cluster_engine.g5k_cluster_engine.get_job`, which are called
    for the scheduling, and implement the client main "business" code
